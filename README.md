<h2>About me</h2>
I am currently in my second year of vocational training to become an IT specialist for application development. I have a great apprenticeship at Icinga GmbH, where I’ve already learned a lot in my first year. I’ve had the chance to explore various fields such as Linux, Command line, SQL, API, networking basics, Git, GitLab, Docker, PHP, Raspberry Pi and (a little bit of) PowerShell. In vocational school, I practiced programming with C# in the first year, and now I'm working with Python in my second year. I'm still excited to discover the vast world of IT, though I now have a clearer sense of just how much there is left to learn!

<h2>About me</h2>
Hello my name is Jolien and I want to become a Software Developer. 
I want to show some of my first tries and experience with coding.
I was working as an art therapist when I discovered my interest in programming. 
I started to learn HTML and CSS and from the first moment I was very fascinated about the structure but also what I do with it. I felt excitement about how I can use it to create something.
