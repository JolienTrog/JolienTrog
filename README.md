<h1>About me</h1>
Hello my name is Jolien Trog and I want to become a Software Developer. 
I want to show some of my first tries and experience with coding.
I was working as an art therapist when I discovered my interest in programming. 
I started to learn HTML and CSS and from the first moment I was very fascinated about the structure but also what I do with it. I felt excitement about how I can use it to create something.
